                <p>Ancient Greece was a northeastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</a> civilization that existed from the 12thâ€“9th centuries BC until the end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Antiquity">classical antiquity</a> &lpar;AD 600&rpar;, 
                    and consisted of a loose collection of culturally and linguistically related city-states and other territories that were unified only once, 
                    under Alexander the Great&rsquo;s empire, for 13 years &lpar;336-323 BC&rpar;.
                <p>Classical Greek culture, particularly philosophy, had a significant impact on ancient Rome &lpar;hence why the Greek gods have Greek and Roman names&rpar;, 
                    which spread a version of it over the Mediterranean and most of Europe. As a result, Classical Greece is often regarded as the cradle of Western civilization, 
                    the fundamental culture from which many of the contemporary West's basic ideals and ideas in politics, philosophy, science, and art are derived.</p>

                <p>Greek mythology is the heart of the myths that were originally told by the ancient Greeks. It is a type of Ancient Greek folklore that consists of a collection of tales.
                    he origins and importance of the ancient Greeks' own cult and ceremonial practises, as well as the lives and actions of deities, heroes, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Greek_mythological_creatures">legendary animals</a>, are all explored in these tales. 
                    The myths are studied by modern researchers to get a better understanding of ancient Greece's religious and political systems, as well as the nature of myth-making itself.
