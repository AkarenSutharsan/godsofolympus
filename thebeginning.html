                <p>In Greek mythology, themes of <span class="emphasis">parental betrayal</span> contrast with tales of <span class="emphasis">filial betrayal</span> are found about the early world. There&rsquo;s also affection and loyalty to be found. 
                They are all of the necessary elements of a solid plotline. Birth and the creation of the universe are inextricably interwoven. 
                Mountains and other physical features of the planet are created via the process of procreation. 
                Granted, it&rsquo;s procreation between entities we don&rsquo;t believe can procreate, but this is an ancient version and part of the ancient mythological worldview.</p>

                <p>Before the 2nd generation of Titans were born, Uranus, who didn&rsquo;t want to have children &lpar;because he was hateful and somewhat scared that one of his children might overthrow him&rpar;
                    shut all his children inside his wife &lpar;mother Gaia&rpar;, just like how her previous husband did.</p>
                <p>But Gaia was angry with him, as Uranus threw her first son &lpar;Cyclopes&rpar; down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus#:~:text=In%20Greek%20mythology%2C%20Tartarus%20(%2F,Plato's%20Gorgias%20(%20c.">Tartarus</a>, and she didn&rsquo;t want any more of her children to be stuck down there,
                    so she had her son, Cronos, to do the dirty work. Cronos, being the dutiful son, used a sickle and castrated his father, leaving him powerless.</p>
                <p>After that Gaia&rsquo;s children were released, rivers and springs, second-generation Titans, Atlas and Prometheus, moon (Selene), sun (Helios), and many others were brought to the world.</p>

                    Cronus swallowed his offspring instead of imprisoning them in his wife&rsquo;s body &lpar;or Tartarus&rpar; since he knew better than to repeat his father&rsquo;s error of leaving himself exposed.</p>
                <p>But just like her mother Gaia, Rhea also wanted her children to be free. So when Zeus was ready to be born, she gave him birth in secret. 
                    Zeus grew up safely until he was old enough to make his father regurgitate his five siblings &lpar;Hades, Poseidon, Demeter, Hera, and Hestia&rpar;.
